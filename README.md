### Prebuilt Binaries

The easiest way to get started is to download a prebuilt binary from the [releases page](https://github.com/zanivann/koshelf/releases). Binaries are available for:

- Windows (x64)
- macOS (Apple Silicon, Intel & Universal)
- Linux (x64 and ARM64)

Please note that KoShelf is a command line tool, so you will need to execute it from within a terminal (macOS/Linux) or PowerShell/Command Prompt on Windows. Simply double-clicking the executable won't work since it requires command line arguments to function properly.

**Note for Windows users**: Windows Defender will likely flag and delete the Windows binary as a virus (more information [here](https://medium.com/opsops/is-windows-broken-7f8de8b8f3ad)). This is a false positive if you downloaded the binary directly from this repo. To use the binary:

1. Restore it from Windows Defender's protection history (Windows Security > Virus & threat protection > Protection history > Restore)
2. Launch the binary from PowerShell or Windows Terminal with arguments - double-clicking will cause it to close immediately since no arguments are provided

#### First Time Using Command Line?

If you've never used a command line before, here's how to get started:

**Windows:**
1. Press `Win + R`, type `powershell`, and press Enter
2. Navigate to where you downloaded the KoShelf binary (e.g., `cd C:\Users\YourName\Downloads`)
3. Run the tool with your desired arguments (see examples below)

**macOS and Linux:**
1. Press `Cmd + Space`, type `terminal`, and press Enter
2. Navigate to where you downloaded the KoShelf binary (e.g., `cd ~/Downloads`)
3. Make the file executable: `chmod +x koshelf` (should not be needed on macOS as the binary is signed)
4. Run the tool with your desired arguments (see examples below)

**Example:**
```bash
# Navigate to your downloads folder
cd ~/Downloads  # macOS/Linux
cd C:\Users\YourName\Downloads  # Windows

# Run KoShelf with your books folder
./koshelf --library-path /path/to/your/library --output ./my-library-site
```
```
**Pro tip:** On most terminals, you can drag and drop the downloaded binary file directly into the terminal window. This will automatically insert the full file path, allowing you to immediately add your arguments and run the command.

If you plan to use KoShelf frequently and use Linux or macOS, you can move the binary to `/usr/local/bin/` to make it available system-wide. This allows you to run `koshelf` from anywhere without specifying the full path:

```bash
# Move the binary to system PATH (requires sudo)
sudo mv koshelf /usr/local/bin/

# Now you can run it from anywhere
koshelf --library-path ~/Books --output ~/my-library-site
```

### From Source

If you prefer to build from source or need a custom build:

#### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.70+ (for building)
- Node.js and npm (for Tailwind CSS compilation)

#### Building the tool

```bash
git clone https://github.com/zanivann/KoShelf
cd KoShelf

# Build the Rust binary
cargo build --release
```

The binary will be available at `target/release/koshelf`.

**Note:** Tailwind CSS will be compiled during build and added to the binary.

## Usage

### Basic Usage

```bash
./koshelf --library-path /path/to/your/library --output ./my-library-site
```

### Operation Modes

KoShelf can operate in several modes:

1. **Static Site Generation**: Generate a static site once and exit (default when `--output` is specified without `--watch`)
2. **Web Server Mode**: Builds a static site in a temporary folder and serves it, automatically rebuilds on book changes (default when `--output` is not specified) 
3. **Watch Mode**: Generate a static site, rebuilding when book files change (when both `--output` and `--watch` are specified)

### Command Line Options

- `-i, --library-path`: Path(s) to folders containing ebooks (EPUB, FB2, MOBI) and/or comics (CBZ, CBR) with KoReader metadata. Can be specified multiple times. (optional if `--statistics-db` is provided)
- `--docsettings-path`: Path to KOReader's `docsettings` folder for users who store metadata separately (requires `--books-path`, mutually exclusive with `--hashdocsettings-path`)
- `--hashdocsettings-path`: Path to KOReader's `hashdocsettings` folder for users who store metadata by content hash (requires `--books-path`, mutually exclusive with `--docsettings-path`)
- `-s, --statistics-db`: Path to the `statistics.sqlite3` file for additional reading stats (optional if `--books-path` is provided)
- `-o, --output`: Output directory for the generated site
- `-p, --port`: Port for web server mode (default: 3000)
- `-w, --watch`: Enable file watching with static output (requires `--output`)
- `-t, --title`: Site title (default: "KoShelf")
- `--include-unread`: Include unread items (files without KoReader metadata)
- `--heatmap-scale-max`: Maximum value for heatmap color intensity scaling (e.g., "auto", "1h", "1h30m", "45min"). Values above this will still be shown but use the highest color intensity. Default is "auto" for automatic scaling
- `--timezone`: Timezone to interpret timestamps (IANA name, e.g., `Australia/Sydney`); defaults to system local
- `--day-start-time`: Logical day start time as `HH:MM` (default: `00:00`)
- `--min-pages-per-day`: Minimum pages read per book per day to be counted in statistics (optional)
- `--min-time-per-day`: Minimum reading time per book per day to be counted in statistics (e.g., "15m", "1h") (optional)
  > **Note:** If both `--min-pages-per-day` and `--min-time-per-day` are provided, a book's data for a day is counted if **either** condition is met for that book on that day. These filters apply **per book per day**, meaning each book must individually meet the threshold for each day to be included in statistics.
- `--include-all-stats`: By default, statistics are filtered to only include books present in your `--books-path` directory. This prevents deleted books or external files (like Wallabag articles) from skewing your recap and statistics. Use this flag to include statistics for all books in the database, regardless of whether they exist in your library.
- `-l, --language`: Language for UI translations. Use full locale code (e.g., `en_US`, `de_DE`, `pt_BR`) for correct date formatting. Default: `en_US`
- `--list-languages`: List all supported languages and exit To see all supported languages: ./koshelf --list-languages
- `--github`: Print GitHub repository URL

### Example

```bash
# Generate site from a library folder
./koshelf -i ~/Library -o ~/my-reading-site -t "My Reading Journey"

# Generate site from multiple folders (e.g., books + comics)
./koshelf -i ~/Books -i ~/Comics -o ~/my-reading-site

# Generate site with statistics and unread items included
./koshelf -i ~/Library -o ~/my-reading-site --statistics-db ~/KOReaderSettings/statistics.sqlite3 --include-unread

# Start web server with live file watching and statistics
./koshelf -i ~/Library -s ~/KOReaderSettings/statistics.sqlite3 -p 8080

# Generate static site with file watching and statistics
./koshelf --library-path ~/Library -o ~/my-reading-site --statistics-db ~/KOReaderSettings/statistics.sqlite3 --watch

# Generate site with custom heatmap color scaling (2 hours = highest intensity)
./koshelf -i ~/Library -s ~/KOReaderSettings/statistics.sqlite3 -o ~/my-reading-site --heatmap-scale-max 2h

# Generate site with custom heatmap color scaling (1.5 hours = highest intensity)
./koshelf -i ~/Library -s ~/KOReaderSettings/statistics.sqlite3 -o ~/my-reading-site --heatmap-scale-max 1h30m

# Generate site with explicit timezone and non-midnight day start (good for night owls)
./koshelf -i ~/Library -s ~/KOReaderSettings/statistics.sqlite3 -o ~/my-reading-site --timezone Australia/Sydney --day-start-time 03:00

# Using hashdocsettings (metadata stored by content hash)
./koshelf -i ~/Books -o ~/my-reading-site --hashdocsettings-path ~/KOReaderSettings/hashdocsettings

# Using docsettings (metadata stored in central folder by path)
./koshelf -i ~/Books -o ~/my-reading-site --docsettings-path ~/KOReaderSettings/docsettings

# Generate site with German UI language
./koshelf -i ~/Library -o ~/my-reading-site --language de_DE
```



## KoReader Setup

### Metadata Storage Options

KOReader offers three ways to store book metadata (reading progress, highlights, annotations). KOShelf supports all three:

#### 1. Default: Metadata Next to Books (Recommended)

By default, KOReader creates `.sdr` folders next to each book file:

```
Books/
├── Book Title.epub
├── Book Title.sdr/
│   └── metadata.epub.lua
├── Another Book.epub
├── Another Book.sdr/
│   └── metadata.epub.lua
└── ...
```

This is the simplest setup - just point `--library-path` to your books folder.

#### 2. Hashdocsettings

If you select "hashdocsettings" in KOReader settings, metadata is stored in a central folder organized by content hash:

```
KOReaderSettings/
└── hashdocsettings/
    ├── 57/
    │   └── 570615f811d504e628db1ef262bea270.sdr/
    │       └── metadata.epub.lua
    └── a3/
        └── a3b2c1d4e5f6...sdr/
            └── metadata.epub.lua
```

**Usage:**
```bash
./koshelf --library-path ~/Books --hashdocsettings-path ~/KOReaderSettings/hashdocsettings
```

#### 3. Docsettings

If you select "docsettings" in KOReader settings, KOReader mirrors your book folder structure in a central folder and stores the metadata there:

```
KOReaderSettings/
└── docsettings/
    └── home/
        └── user/
            └── Books/
                ├── Book Title.sdr/
                │   └── metadata.epub.lua
                └── Another Book.sdr/
                    └── metadata.epub.lua
```

**Note:**  Unlike KOReader, KOShelf matches books by filename only, since the folder structure reflects the device path (which may differ from your local path). If you have multiple books with the same filename, KOShelf will show an error - use `hashdocsettings` or `book folder` instead.

**Usage:**
```bash
./koshelf --library-path ~/Books --docsettings-path ~/KOReaderSettings/docsettings
```

### Typical Deployment Setup

Although there are many ways to use this tool here is how I use it:

1. **Syncthing Sync**: I use [Syncthing](https://syncthing.net/) to sync both my books folder and KoReader settings folder from my e-reader to my server
2. **Books and Statistics**: I point to the synced books folder with `--books-path` and to `statistics.sqlite3` in the synced KoReader settings folder with `--statistics-db`
3. **Web Server Mode**: I then run KoShelf in web server mode (without `--output`) - it will automatically rebuild when files change
4. **Nginx Reverse Proxy**: I use an nginx reverse proxy for HTTPS and to restrict access

My actual setup:
```bash
# My server command - runs continuously with file watching and statistics
./koshelf --library-path ~/syncthing/Books \
         --statistics-db ~/syncthing/KOReaderSettings/statistics.sqlite3 \
         --port 3009
```

This way, every time Syncthing pulls updates from my e-reader, the website automatically updates with my latest reading progress, new highlights, and updated statistics.

### User-Contributed Setups
