# ===========================================
#       English (en) — Base Language File
# ===========================================
# This is the base translation file for English, using US English vocabulary.
# Regional variants (e.g., en_GB.ftl) should only override keys that differ.
#
# LOCALE HIERARCHY:
#   1. Regional variant (e.g., en_GB.ftl) — sparse, only differences
#   2. Base language (this file) — complete translations
#   3. English fallback (en.ftl) — ultimate fallback for all languages
#
# NEW KEYS: Always add new translation keys to en.ftl first, then other bases.

# Machine-readable metadata (used by --list-languages)
